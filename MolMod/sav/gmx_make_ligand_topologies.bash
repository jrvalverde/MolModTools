# NAME
#	make_ligand_topologies
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	make_ligand_topologies ligand.pdb charge
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Create a topology for a ligand PDB file using various methods.
#
#	By default we assume a charge of 0 if not specified.
#
#	Ligand topologies will be built using topolgen (for OPLS/AA),
#	topolbuild (OPLS-AA), mktop (AMBER and OPLS-AA) and 
#	acpype (for all other force fields, plus a temptative OPLS/AA topology).
#
#	If a ligand.mol2 file already exists, in addition to the PDB file,
#	it will be assumed to contain the atomic point charges, and use
#	to build the topology.
#
#	If a ligand.mol2 file does not already exist, or building the
#	topology with the provided one fails, then it will attempt to
#	crate one using UCSF Chimera and AM1-BCC to compute charges.
#
#	If a ligand.mol2 file does not exist, and Chimera failed to build
#	one, then we will first try to compute charges using Semi-empirical
#	Quantum Mechanics implementation in Antechamber (sqm)
#
#	if that also fails, we will try other models using babel to
#	generate a new mol2 file to use as template. The various methods
#	available in babel will be tried in the following hardcoded order
#
#		QTPIE QEq EEM MMFF94 Gasteiger
#
#	If even that fails, we will resort to using less accurate Gasteiger
#	charges using Antechamber.
#
#	If that also fails, then we give up.
#
#	Output files are:
#		lig.oplsaa.itp	- OPLS/AA tology built by topolgen, with
#			charges corrected by .mol2 if it exists.
#		lig.acpype/*	- toplogies for a variety of force fields
#			and systems built by acpype, with charges corrected
#			according to the fallback protocol described above.
