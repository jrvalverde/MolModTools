function usage {
    cat <<END

    Usage: $myname -i input.pdb -h -p pH -m add_H_method -s -c -S -l ligands
    		   -T Temp -P Press -O -E -M -L
    
    	Run a full Gromacs simulation using the AMBER force field.
        
	if -h is used, then H will be added to the system. By default
        a physiologic pH is used. H may be added using Chimera, or
        babel, in which case, a different pH may be specified with -p
        
        This command will analyze the input file looking for ligands, and
        if any are found, will generate the parameters for them using
        ACPYPE. A list of ligands to process can be given instead, and
        in this case, charges for each ligand may be specified.
        
        Once all parameters have been generated, the system will be
        solvated and ions will be added to compensate charges (-s) or,
        if -S is specified, to simulate physiologic saline serum.
        
        After the system has been set up, it will be energy minimized,
        equilibrated, first in NVT and then in NPT, and finally an MD
        run in NPT will be computed.
        
        At each step, relevant statistics will be collected.
        
        Parameters:

                -?	print this help
        	-i	input file in PDB format
                -h	add H to the system
                -m	method to use for adding H (chimera or babel)
		-p	pH to consider for adding H (only used if method
                	is babel) [7.365]
                -s	solvate 
                -c	add counterions to neutralize system charges
                	(implies -s/solvate)
                -S	solvate using physiologic saline serum 
                	(implies -s/solvate and cancels -c/counterions)
                -l	file with a list of ligands, format is
                	'LIG	charge'
                -T	target temperature in Kelvin [310]
                -P	target pressure in bar [1.0]
                -O	add an optimization (energy minimization) run
                -E	add an equilibration run (implies -O)
                -M	add a short 5ns MD run (implies -O -E -A)  
                -L	add a longer 20ns MD run (implies -O -E -M -A)
		-A	analyze MD run
        
        Other files:
        	\$LIG.mol2 for any ligand \$LIG, if a \$LIG.mol2 file exists, it
                	will be used to assign charges to its atoms (instead
                        of using SQM BCC1 or Gasteiger charges if that fails)

	; NVT EQUILIBRATION
	; This file calls for an MD run of 100,000 steps with a 2 fs timestep (a total 
	; of 200 ps). The 'define = -DPOSRES' line initiates the backbone restraints 
	; on the protein, which should remain on until production MD. Temperature 
	; coupling is performed using the Berendsen method. In order to be sure 
	; velocities (and therefore temperature) are evenly distributed across all of 
	; the molecule types, it is a good idea to couple protein atoms and 
	; non-protein atoms to separate baths. Without separate coupling, you run the 
	; risk weird phenomena such as a system where the water molecules are at 
	; 350 K and the protein is at 200 K. Finally, all bonds are constrained using 
	; the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm. Review the GROMACS manual 
	; if you are unfamiliar with the implementation or purpose of any of these 
	; parameters.

    # EM ensured that we have a reasonable starting structure, in terms of 
    # geometry and solvent orientation. To begin real dynamics, we must equilibrate 
    # the solvent and ions around the protein. If we were to attempt unrestrained 
    # dynamics at this point, the system may collapse. The reason is that the 
    # solvent is mostly optimized within itself, and not necessarily with the 
    # solute. It needs to be brought to the temperature we wish to simulate and 
    # establish the proper orientation about the solute (the protein). After we 
    # arrive at the correct temperature (based on kinetic energies), we will apply 
    # pressure to the system until it reaches the proper density.
    #
    # Remember that posre.itp file that pdb2gmx generated a long time ago? 
    # We're going to use it now. The purpose of posre.itp is to apply a position 
    # restraining force on the heavy atoms of the protein (anything that is not 
    # a hydrogen). Movement is permitted, but only after overcoming a substantial 
    # energy penalty. The utility of position restraints is that they allow us to 
    # equilibrate our solvent around our protein, without the added variable of 
    # structural changes in the protein.
    #

    # Equilibration is often conducted in two phases. The first phase is conducted
    # under an NVT ensemble (constant Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature).
    # This ensemble is also referred to as "isothermal-isochoric" or "canonical." 
    # The timeframe for such a procedure is dependent upon the contents of the 
    # system, but in NVT, the temperature of the system should reach a plateau at 
    # the desired value. If the temperature has not yet stabilized, additional 
    # time will be required. Typically, 50-100 ps should suffice, and we will
