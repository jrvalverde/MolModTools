# NAME
#	run_md - run a Molecular Mechanics or Molecular Dynamics simulation
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	run_md simulation coordinates
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	run_md runs a Molecular Mechanics or Molecular Dynamics simulation
#	using a configuration file named 'simulation.mdp' over a coordinates
#	and topology dataset.
#
#	simulation must be the name of a Gromacs input configuration file
#	WITHOUT the .mdp extension. This name will be used as the base to
#	generate the names for subsequent files produced during the run.
#
#	coordinates must be the name of the coordinates/topology dataset
#	files, again WITHOUT extention. The actual atomic coordinates will
#	be run from a Gromacs or PDB file named 'coordinates.gro' or
#	'coordinates.pdb', and the topology will be read from a Gromacs
#	topology file named 'coordinates.top'
#
#	The coordinates provided will be used as the starting topology
#	for the run. Once the run is finished, all files generated will
#	be named after the provided run-name:
#
#		.gro	-- final coordinates in Gromcas format
#		.pdb	-- final coordinates in PDB format (generated
#			using the original coordinates as a reference 
#			to recover chain assignments)
#		.top	-- final topology
#		out.mdp	-- the actual parameters used
#		.tpr .trr .xtc	-- trajectory files (high and low resolution)
#		_noPBC.xtc	-- trajectory files (PBC removed for analysis)
#
