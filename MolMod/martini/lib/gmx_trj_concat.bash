# NAME
#	gmx_trj_concat -- concatenate GROMACS trajectories
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	gmx_trj_concat prefix
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	If a file named $prefix.{xtc|trj} does not exist, look for
# files named ${md}_number.trr or generally ${md}*.trr and concatenate
# them to obtain a $md.trr file. In the process, also generate if needed
# and join XTC equivalent trajectories for all parts and the final total,
# and concatenate their corresponding energgy .EDR files.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#	prefix	- the prefix to identify the parts and final outputs
