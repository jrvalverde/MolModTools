# NAME
#    gmx_trr_to_xtc - convert trr trajectory to xtc (and optionally subselect)
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    gmx_trr_to_xtc [trajectory] [step_ps] [subset]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Convert a GROMACS trajectory from TRR format to XTC format. The
# name of the trajectory (without extension) must be provided. If no
# name is provided, then the default "md" will be used. It can
# optionally subsample the trajectory taking one frame each $step_ps
# picoseconds. If no 'step_ps' is given or it is an empty value ('') or iff 0 
# is specified, then all frames will be output. It can also optionally
# export only part of the simulation system if subset is specified with
# the name or number of the desired subset in the corresponding (or the
# default) index.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#	trajectory	- the trajectory name (without extension), optional,
#			defaults to 'md'
#	step_ps		- a time in ps to use for subsampling, optional,
#			defaults to 0 (i.e. output all frames)
#	subset		- the part of the system (as specified in the index
#			file) to select for output, defaults to 'System'
#			(i.e. output the whole simulation system)
