# NAME
#	gmx_trj_subsample - subsample a gromacs trajectory to extract
#		frames at a given period in picoseconds (and optionally
#		select a subset).
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	add_H input.pdb trajectory step_ps subset
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Used to rduce the dimensions of a trajectory file.
#
# Sometimes you may generate a trajectory file that is too heavy (in the order
# of hundreds of GB).
#
# You can imagine that handling these types of files is not really practical.
# From time to time you may want to transfer the trajectories from one
# workstation to another, or to your local laptop.
#
# In such cases, it is useful to “lighten” the trajectory and make it less
# memory-consuming to facilitate data transfer.
#
# What we can do is create an additional xtc file with a lower number of
# frames (amd optionally containing only a subset of the simulation system).
#
# There should be a trajectory named "$trajectory.{xtc|trr}" and a run input
# file named "$trajectory.tpr" in the same folder. If an
# index file "$trajectory.ndx" also exists, then it will be used for the 
# selection of the subsystem to be saved. Otherwise the default index will
# be used.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#	trajectory	- optional, default "md", the trajectory to subsample
#	step_ps		- optional, default "1", time in picoseconds, we will
#			extract one frame every $step_ps picoseconds
#	subset		- optional, default "System", select only a specific 
#			part of the system you are interested in
