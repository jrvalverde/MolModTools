# NAME
#	gmx_center_noPBC - remove PBC and center part of a structure
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	gmx_center_noPBC [struct] [center] [subset]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Take an structure (GRO, PDB, XTC, TRR) and center around a
# simulation group, optionally saving only part of the simulation system.
#
#	'struct' must be a structure file name with extension or not. The name
# will be used to search for a suitable tructure, in order of priority,
# ending in .gro .pdb .xtc or .trr it it lacks a valid extension or it is
# not directly found.
#
#	There should be a run input file named $struct.tpr,
# If an accompanying index file $trj_name.ndx is found, it will also be 
# used, otherwise it will use the default index.
#
#	If a center group is not specified, 'System' will be used and only
# PBC removal will take place, otherwise, the center group (which must be
# defined in the index) will be used to center the system around it.
#
#	An optional subset can also be specified to output only part of the
# simulation system. It must correspond to a valid subset in the index.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#	structure	- the name (without extension) of the structure,
#			optional, defaults to 'system'
#	center		- optional, the name of a valid group in the index
#			to center around
#	subset		- optional, the name of a valid group in the index
#			to select for output
