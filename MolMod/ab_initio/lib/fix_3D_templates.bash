    # THIS IS BECAUSE IN SOME CASES, PepBuilder results in negative coordinates
    # larger than -1000.000. This shifts all the coordinates one space right
    # and breaks the PDB format, leading to a failure of CABS.
    # Chimera can read the pdb file and "fix" the coordinates so we just
    # read the file and save it again. This does not actually FIX the file,
    # but distorts the X and Y coordinates so they fit in the box.
    # Thus, it results in a distorted starting structure, but we do not
    # care because any way, we will model it extensively with CABS.
